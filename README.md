# EXAGEN: Expert Augmented Generation System

## Project Overview

EXAGEN (Expert Augmented Generation System) is a research project aimed at integrating large language models (LLMs) with symbolic computation tools to solve complex mathematical problems. The system is being developed at IIT Bombay under the guidance of Prof. Asim Tewari, focusing on enhancing explainability and improving the accuracy and efficiency of AI-driven mathematical problem-solving tools. 

The project explores novel ways to combine the strengths of LLMs (like LLaMA2 and GPT) with symbolic computation libraries such as SymPy and Wolfram to solve math problems across various domains. EXAGEN's key features include:

- **Problem Classification**: A multi-criteria classification system to evaluate math problems based on complexity, ambiguity, and domain requirements.
- **Multi-Step Reasoning**: Structured pathways for sequential problem-solving, helping break down complex problems like vector calculus.
- **Error Handling and Refinement**: Iterative error correction loops to optimize code generated by LLMs.
- **Dataset Augmentation**: Use of LLMs to generate augmented datasets with classification features and step-by-step solutions for various mathematical problems.

## Technologies Used

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: LLaMA2, GPT for language processing and problem interpretation.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple models to improve performance and robustness.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Enhanced information retrieval for text documents (e.g., PDFs).
- **Symbolic Computation Tools**: SymPy and Wolfram for precise symbolic calculations and solving complex mathematical problems.
- **Dataset Augmentation**: LLMs used for generating augmented datasets, such as the LILA dataset, to improve problem-solving capabilities.
